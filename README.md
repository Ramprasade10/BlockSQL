# BlockSQL
The BlockSQL has been designed to facilitate and help the Students, Teachers and Database Administrators of our college. It is a user-friendly, secure application implementing the concept of blockchain to provide students with ease of examination related facilities online and help smoothen the operations of the COE’s office.

We recognized that there were shortcomings in the current system of Examination such as requesting for provisional marks card, transcript and accessing the previous results, question papers and other resources, and hence, wanted to help by solving it. 

We decided to choose this as our project because we wanted to solve an existing issue in the college. So, we approached our project guides, Mr. Yogesh M J and Ms. Ramya S, to seek their guidance and support. They encouraged us and helped us in approaching the HOD of Computer Science, Principal and the COE to obtain previous years data to solve the shortcomings in the system.

They understood the problems faced by the students and the college, and gave us permission to
obtain the meta data required to implement the features in our application.

### BLOCKCHAIN IMPLEMENTATION:
The principles of Blockchain are used to ensure data security, integrity and consistency. It helps to see to it that the data is not tampered. This is done by adding the attributes of a block in a blockchain to the tables in the database(time_stamp, prev_block_hash, block_hash).

### STUDENTS:

The students can access and view their previous semester results and current semester results. Students can also view and download question papers of previous internals and examinations effortlessly. A request can also be made to obtain a copy of their provisional marks card and a copy of their transcript.

Data Analysis and visualization is used to generate useful graphs about student performanceusing matplotlib library from the provided data.

### TEACHERS:
Teachers can insert as well as update student marks and upload question papers.

### DATABASE ADMINISTRATORS:
Database administrator plays a crucial role in maintaining and ensuring integrity of database. The system provides complete control over the database system. They are allowed to execute required queries on the database.
They also have information regarding the various logins by users and their time of logins.
They can add details of new teachers and students during admission to the
database.
